    <td>we learned with the booklets instructions. Me and my partner talked about which code we should use and we decided to make a space invader then we moved on to the flashing lights. I think that using our own knowledge and instructions was effective.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that editing and changing my old code held me back and limited my learning because other people got on to making the flashing lights code. If we left our old code alone and carried on through the book then we could have used the electric components with the fuze box. I think I need to work on saving the code because we spend  time on saving it a we take time to find the code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think next time I will go ahead in the instructions and try new code and start on the flashing lights. I will improve my learning by trying out new types of code and how to use the electric components for the flashing lights.</td>
