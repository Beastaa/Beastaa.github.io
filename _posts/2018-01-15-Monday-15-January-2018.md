Lesson 4        15/01/18

In today's lesson we were working more on updating our blogs. In my previous blog I tried to embed my spreadsheet onto it but it just showed the code an not the actual spreadsheet. I was trying to fix this this lesson because it worked perfectly fine the lesson before and I was really confused. Then I compared it with my friend's blog and saw that he deleted the spaces so I deleted my spaces and it worked! The code I used was <iframe height="405" width= "720" src= (The link to my spreadsheet) ></iframe> I got this from my teacher

But when you apply it to github code it will appear as the spreadsheet on the bottom. I think that I worked efficiently in today's lesson because I solved a problem which was annoying me.
