Computer Science lesson 31                                      27.11.18

In today's lesson we had a coding lesson where we were making any project using repl.it on python 3. I changed my amzebot code so that it printed more intereting things and I made it so that you can choose for it to predict the future or for it to say something that is currently happening. Then near the end of the lesson our teacher told us to try and code an algorithm that will search for a number in a list and print its index, this was called a linear search. Then he told us to do some code at home for a binary search which guess the users number by halving the total amount of numbers each time s the number will either be above or below that number. If the list was from 1 to 100 then it will only take 8 tries to find the number as this is more efficient and faster than the linear search. The linear search just check every number to try and see if it is the chosen number.
