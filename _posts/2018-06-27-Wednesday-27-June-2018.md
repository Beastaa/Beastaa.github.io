Computer Science lesson 6                           27.06.18

Today's lesson was a cover lesson so we were doing coding practice. Me and my partner were doing codecombat. I managed to make huge progress and I brought the best armor available to me. Other people made a clan but we weren't invited so currently I am clanless. I managed to progress through the Forest world.
