    <td>I learnt by listening to the teacher and taking notes of what it was doing so i could easily apply it to my sheet. I also asked the person sitting next to me when I got stuck and he helped me to find out what I did wrong and how to correct it. They were effective strategy and I also found that when the teacher put the hardest line on the board to copy down was also a useful strategy.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that me working fast limited my learning because I finished what we were supposed to do in the first 6 minutes and there wasn't any other work to do so I added a bunch of items to my shopping list. I think I need to work on not getting distracted because there were so distractions when the teacher was doing his demonstration.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change my working pace so that I will spend more time on each one of the lines so that I can easily understand why I am writing certain stuff. I will inprove my learning by thinking how I could apply this to a job in the future and I will also try to understand the theory behind the code.</td>
