Lesson 19                                 28.06.18

In today's lesson I was finishing the second version of my multiple choice quiz. I was working really hard through it during the beginning of the lesson and I made quite a few mistakes and I had to go into my history nad get my previous quiz up to restart it. Then at the very end of the lesson I managed to have a major break through and have the main ideals of the quiz work, that is having the questions and answers printed on the screen. But the only problem was that The final answer would not work.
