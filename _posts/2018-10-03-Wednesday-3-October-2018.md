Computer science lesson 20                                03.10.18

In today's lesson we were using a website called thimble to create a webpage for our blogs instead of using github. The majority of this lesson was making the layout of my website. I copied the scss code foom my github and put it into my thimble so that I had a similar style form my github site. I created a home page where I put 4 buttons that would eventually lead to my blogs from year 7 to 10 (My current blogs). I spent some of the lesson trying to add my background to the webpage and I finally managed to do it in the end.
