Lesson 22                                                      19.07.18

Today was my last lesson of IT in year nine and my last lesson before the holidays and ever because in year 10 there is no IT and there is only computer science. In this lesson I decided to do something different and work on some coding puzzles in the online worksheet on my teachers google site. I managed to do these on repl.it, what I did was solve problems while coding. For example the worksheet would say write a program that tells a joke and waits for the users input to tell the punch line instead of telling all of it straight away.
