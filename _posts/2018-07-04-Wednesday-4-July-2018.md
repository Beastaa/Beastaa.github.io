Computer Science lesson 8                      04.07.18

Today's lesson was mainly based on coding, which will happen every Wednesday. I was doing my code on and codeCombat. I progressed through the forest and managed to complete it with some difficulty. Then I realised that I could buy items on the inventory so I brought an ruby chestplate which increased my health to a high amount. This helped me fight of Ogres and other creatures later on when I found out that I could redo certain parts of the map. I managed to make lots of progress through the forest world.
