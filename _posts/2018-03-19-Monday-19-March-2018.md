Lesson 12                   19.03.18

In today's lesson we were working on repl.it using python (with turtle). We spent all of the lesson on what we were told was a simple task, drawing a 3D T with coulo. This is easier said than done . I struggle a lot with this and none of the other people in the class could complete this task because there was a lot of code and we had to color it in as well. When the lesson ended our teacher told us that the point of today's lesson was not to copy other people but to work out the solution using what you already know. I tried to complete this task for home work but I could only get a little bit done.
