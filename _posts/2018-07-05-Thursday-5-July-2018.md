Lesson 20                               05.07.18

In today's IT lesson I was adding some finishing touches to my quiz. I was trying to find out ways to make my result answers to print but I tried it and couldn't. So people who do computer Science were allowed to practice our coding on codecombat, I used this to improve my code and see where I got stuck. I then realised that there was a level which came with great difficulty for me ao I had to stop and think it through. But I couldn’t complete it so I made the decision to finish it at home and to do more practice so that in the future I won’t get stuck when it comes to parts like that.
