Computer Science lesson 25                                          06.11.18

Today's lesson was about networking, we started it be answering recap questions from what we did last half term. Then we worked on encryption the slides used are on classroom. Encryption is a way to protect data as the original data is changed according to a key and the person how the data is intended for will also have the same key to decode it, this is useful against hackers as the message will not make sense to them without a key.This method does not prevent hacking but it keeps the data secure. 2FA is 2 factor authentication this is used to identify a person accessing a network, any two methods can be from something you know (Password), something you are (Biometric fingerprint) and something you have (a mobile phone). 2FA is useful as this ensures that the person accessing the network is trustworthy and not a hacker. We also talked about firewalls and MAC address filtering, firewalls are software or hardware that banned access for certain ports like FTP and it blocks unwanted traffic, MAC address filtering is when certain MAC address for devices are allowed access to the network.
