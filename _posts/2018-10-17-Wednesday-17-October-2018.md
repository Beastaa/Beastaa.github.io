Computer Science Lesson 24                                                    17.10.18

Today's lesson was a coding less. Now in these coding lessons I add more HTML code to my website and improve how it looks so that I can add my future blogs on to it. I found a way to make my container and hyperlink work so that helped me a lot as it made my site better. I added a new HTML file so that I could add a link to my past Github blog so that people on my website can show all of my previous blogs I used the link from this HTML to connect to my index.html so that the index.html has a link to the blog library. I manage to customize my containers and buttons on my site so that it has a nice look. In the future I will find a way to add all of my blogs from year 7 to my Github or my thimble and I will also find a way to add all of my future blogs directly onto my thimble site.
