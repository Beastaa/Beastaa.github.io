Lesson 5           22/01/18

In today's lesson I learnt a lot of new applications I can use on my Google sheet. I learnt how to make a new sheet which is much cleaner that can organise the lists and say how much money I have and how much profit I can make. I also saw how to use voucher codes to get discounts on certain items, this was done on a separate sheet and I could just copy the code onto my projections sheet to make it all neat so if a person with no experience of coding was using it they would understand everything on the sheet. I really enjoyed today's lesson because if I needed to I could use these skills to help me out in the future. You can have a look at my sheet down below.
