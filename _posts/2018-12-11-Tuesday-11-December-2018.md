Computer science lesson 35                                              11.12.18

In today's lesson we were doing a coding challenge to make blackjack online. I decided to work with my partner as we had different approaches that both made sense. We made the lists and made functions for drawing and sticking but whenever it drew there is random code that appears. So we decided to make a new repl and we put the same code there but it still didnâ€™t work.
