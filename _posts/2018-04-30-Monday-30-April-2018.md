Lesson 15                     30.04.18

In today's lesson we progressed into to making the code for our repl.it questions and answers. I had already made my questions and my method on a google doc, so today we worked on what to code use to make the multiple choice quiz. The code I used was \n which leaves a space underwhat is placed before it. I made lots of progress in the lesson but then all my progress was gone so I had to quickly recover my work. This made me end the lesson with some extra homework to finish my work. I managed to finish it at home so all I need to do complete is the rest of my questions by copy and pasting my previous code.
