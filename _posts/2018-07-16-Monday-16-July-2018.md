Computer Science lesson 11                                 16.07.18

In today's lesson we were doing some coding. I managed to make lots of progress on Codecombat and completed many levels. This was our third last lesson of code combat because after the holidays we would have to move on to more hard programs like chek.io. I managed to unlock new spectacles which would give me infinite viewing range.
