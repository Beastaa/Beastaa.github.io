Lesson 14                   23.04.18

We started today's lesson by doing buzzfeed quizzes. I did the ones with marvel characters in them. Then we talked about the purpose of those quizzes, which were to make money from advertisements. Then we talked about making our own quizzes using python. We only started it in today's lesson so we had to write a plan of what the main question is and we had to make 8 other questions. We also had to choose our method for the result mine was a tally and points. My main question was which member of the fantastic four are you? I am really looking forward to making the quiz and trying it out on people.
