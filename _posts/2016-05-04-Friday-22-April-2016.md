In this week's lesson we wached a viedo which is in this link [https://www.microbit.co.uk/watch-video](https://www.microbit.co.uk/watch-video) and we got introduced to something new called bbc micro:bit. We were meant to have these on March 22 but they are a month late apparently this is happening around the world. But that didn't stop us from discovering more.We went on bbc micro:bit website which is [https://www.microbit.co.uk/](https://www.microbit.co.uk/) and started learning the basics then we started playing arond withe the micro:bit.
