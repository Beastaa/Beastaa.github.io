Lesson 9                  26.02.18

In today's lesson we stopped doing the binary encryption sheet and we started using repl.it. On that we were using python(with turtle). In this we were writing instructions in python telling a turtle where to move and how much to move. When I moved it left a black trail behind it so we could make the turtle draw shapes. Our first task was to make it draw a circle, this was easy to do because if you set the sides and length variable to 40 them it would draw a circle. Then we had to add one line of code that would make the turtle draw every shape. This was also easy to do and I completed both tasks. Then we were told to experiment with the code at home. This lesson was really fun because it was something new that I have never done before and it was really interesting.
