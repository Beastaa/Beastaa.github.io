Computer science lesson 26                                                          07.11.18

In today's lesson we had a coding test we had 7 exercises on classroom to complete. The first exercise was making a border around an inputted name, getting the name as an input was easy but I spent lots of time working out how to make the border. I completely forgot about the len() function because I knew I needed it but I didn't know what to write. Then I remembered it and finished the code. The output was a name completely surrounded by a border of stars that fits the length of the name. I managed to get halfway through the second exercise by the end of the lesson which was called mastermind, I had to code a program that chooses 4 random numbers that are under 10 and the user had to guess the numbers and if they got 1 number right there will be the number 1 and so on. Once the user guesses all four it prints well done and it says the amount of tries the user took. I finished this off at home and I started doing the third exercise which was average calculator. We were told to complete the exercise we were on and hand it in but I decided to do one more exercise.
