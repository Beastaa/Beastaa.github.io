Lesson 6         29/01/18

In today's lesson I was working on my sheet to improve my profit. I added the rest of my Items to my list and changed the prices so that I could get more money. I also added more code to my sheet including values for my employees pay and I was working on finding how much money I would have left after all of my expenses were paid. I also saw a my teachers sheet and saw what he did to help me add new things and writ more code. You can view my Google sheet below.
