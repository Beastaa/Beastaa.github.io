Computer Science lesson 4                                 20.06.18

In the whole of today's lesson we were doing coding practice. We had many sources on the school computer science site. We could use codecademy, code combat, codingame and various other sites. I spent the whole lesson on codecombat and I found it very fun and useful for my progres in code. I managed to finish the first map and now i am properly 100% finishing it taking different paths.
