Computer science lesson 36                                 08.01.19

In today's lesson we were looking at the transmission of data packets with pariti which changes the packet so that the data works. Then we were looking at how barcode scanners work, I found out that the check digit is the last digit and the beginning and the end of the barcode have certain thickness so the scanner can tell which side is which. We ended the lesson by looking at file formats and getting the definitions for the formats.
