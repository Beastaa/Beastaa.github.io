Today in class we were looking at tutorials on the micro:bit (which still hasn't arrived) .We were told to do all of them over the next few weeks ,we were given an instruction manual on how to do the tutorials as well as the online micro:bit instructions. Our homework was to send 20-30 minutes on the tutorials.
