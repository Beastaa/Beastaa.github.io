Computer Science Lesson 1             11.06.18

This is actually our 3rd lesson of computer science but the first lesson was us looking at the specification and the second was working on a pseudo code vending machine. In today's lesson we were learning about binary, hexadecimal and denary conversions.  We managed to learn the conversions. When we first started I found it really difficult but then at the end I managed to do all of the easily. We have to learn these for a test on Wednesday.
