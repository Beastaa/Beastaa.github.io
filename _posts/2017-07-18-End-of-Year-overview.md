    <td>I.T in year 8 was really fun and useful, I learned a lot of new things which made me understand how technology and coding works. The beginning with the fuze boxes helped me to understand how to layout code and what variables did. When I moved on to the robot arm I was really excited about making it move. At the end I moved onto codecademy which helped me learn lots of basic coding and I was really happy with my progress and knowledge. Throughout all of the lessons I faced many problems and struggles which I overcomed with the help of my teacher. I also realised there were a lot of problems which the way I write code and that when I write code i have to be specific or my code won't work. To overall conclude the year I would say I enjoyed it and I learnt a lot of new ways to code.</td>
