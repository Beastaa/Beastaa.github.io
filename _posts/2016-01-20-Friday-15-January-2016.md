In class we talked about text and subtext. Mr Keen showed us a video of the Kia soul and asked us what the text and subtext is.

In the video the text was what the video showed ( images and words) 

The subtext was the stuff it didn't show ( faults and bad sides)

We also went around the classroom playing media literacy bingo
