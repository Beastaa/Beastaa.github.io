**Lesson 3****                                                                              **                                          **08/01/18**

Happy new year!

Today's lesson was the first one back from the holidays and we were updating our blogs. I have added the link to my spreadsheet on this blog and the blog before. From now on I won't use the table formatting because it is a bit old I couldn't write about the things I did in the lessons, for example in the first lesson we used vlookup which searched through a vertical column for words and iferror which left the box blank if there was an error with the code. I learnt how to link my google sheets to my blog and how to adjust the size of it. I also updated my description. The problems I faced was on adjusting the size of the spreadsheet but I solved it by looking at what the teacher did.
