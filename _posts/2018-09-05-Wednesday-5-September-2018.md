Computer Science Lesson 13                                    05.09.18

Today's lesson was the first one in year 10. We were doing coding and I started doing chec.io, I found out that this was a really fun way to code and managed to make lots of progress through House password. I worked on it with my partner, this turned out to be a very effective way to work as we exchanged ideas and managed to get more work done. Near the end of the lesson we managed to make the checking system work but the code in the editor said that there was an error in one of the premade passwords even though we couldn't find it. We asked other people and they said it was the same for them and the teacher also tried to see what to do with the code but by that time the lesson had ended. O did more code at home to see if I could fix it but I couldn't.
