Computer Science lesson 27                                                   13.11.18

Today's lesson was a networks lesson I learnt about protocols and my pair were doing TCP which is transmission control protocol this splits up data into packets and numbers them, it also does error checking and correcting. Network protocols are a set of agreed rules that  must be followed for servers to communicate with each other. We also summarised our networks topic as we will have a test nect week on the whole topic as we have finished it
