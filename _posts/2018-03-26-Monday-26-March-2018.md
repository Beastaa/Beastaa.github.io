Lesson 13                                              26.03.18

In today's lesson we were making a prime number checking. We were using python three and to start off we were thinking of the questions that the program has to ask to determine if the number is even or not. Then we used this because all prime numbers are not even so we had to work on other questions. We learnt a new import function which was import math this allowed us to use mathematical functions such as sqrt.() which was square root. On the example that Mr.Keen did he used mathematical functions but me and 2 other friends worked together and made a version that doesnâ€™t use mathematical functions. Unlike last lesson I managed to finish all the work in class.
