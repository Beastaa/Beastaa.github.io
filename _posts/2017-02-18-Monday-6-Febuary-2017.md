    <td>I learned buy using the booklet and edited my old code me and my partner tried many things out and added new things. We were starting to add imager for my code so it looked more appealing. I think that sharing ideas with my partner was effective because we adapted our ideas to make it look better and more interesting.</td>

    <td>I think that setting up still took a long time and saving our work took a bit long so I think I need to work on that because we could have had more time to do our code and to get hard parts of code fineshed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to improve on setting up and saving the work. I think I will change the code so I use more types of code and I will go and try the hader and longer pieces of code so I can improve my learning and know how to use different ways of code.</td>
