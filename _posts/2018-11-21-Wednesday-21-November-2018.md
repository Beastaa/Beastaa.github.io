Computer science lesson 30                                    21.11.18

Today's lesson was a coding lesson, we were told to try and make a project in repl.it. Some people were looking at inspire bot and the teacher said it would be good to try and code that. So I decided to make amazebot which randomly generates quotes about the user. I made a list of pronouns, then I made a list of verbs and another list of pronouns. I made the code randomly choose one word from each list so that it will randomly generate a quote. I started to edit it so that in different scenarios it will get words that correlate in that scenario.
