Lesson 8        19.02.18

In today's lesson we were adding on to our encryption sheet that we were using last lesson. We were adding binary to it specifically 8 bit binary this is because it is easier to use one and zero when sending information because the 1 is yes and the 0 is no. We copied a table of binary and keyboard digits on to our sheet then we had to move the symbols of the digits to the the first column so that our vlookup would work because the searches right to left. The we added a second sheet which would have our original binary and our concatenate binary. I got a bit confused for the code that goes there then I was told I have the right stuff but in a different order my teacher told me to check my code from my virtual shop that we used in our last lesson to help me with this code. I had to use dec2bin() which changes the dec numbers which are the normal numbers to binary digits of one and zero like 8 bit binary. I could not complete this so I will have to carry on working on this in my next lesson.
