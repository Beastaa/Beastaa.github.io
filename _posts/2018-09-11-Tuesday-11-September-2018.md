Computer science Lesson 13                                           11.09.18

Today's lesson was a cover lesson and all we did was coding. We had three options for coding which were Chekio, codingame, clash of code. I started on clash of code because that is multiplayer in codingame. I joined a clash with the person sitting next to me but we couldn’t complete any of them because we found it difficult. We tried other clash but we couldn’t complete it. So we decided to move to the practice section in codingame and complete the descent which took us some time to complete. Then we tried other ones but we couldn’t do them. We then progressed on to check.io and tried lots of exercises but it always said that there was an error in our code. I searched online how to use checkio because everything I did always said it was wrong even when it worked. I went on a couple of fourms but they were not that useful, so I decided to do some more exercises.
