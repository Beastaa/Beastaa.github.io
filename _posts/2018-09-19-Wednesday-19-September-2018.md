Computer science Lesson 16                              16.09.18

In today's lesson we were using rep.it to make a coded version of the bubble sort for a long list. I made a new repl and added lots of code to make it run the check function for all the numbers in the list. I later found out that I was overcomplicating it and I started to make it a lot simpler. I spent the whole lesson doing this and I managed to make some progress by modifying my for loop.
