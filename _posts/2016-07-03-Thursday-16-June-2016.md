Before I carry on with this blog this blog is going to be a bit different because all the blogs I have done so far are not what  I was meant to do be I was meant to write about what I learnt in the lesson not what I did. Today I learnt that making a game on a micro bit isn't as easy as it looks like. We started making our games my game is called Dot Flash. Some people worked in partners and the others worked alone  I was one of those people that worked alone.
