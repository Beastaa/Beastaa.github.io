GOOD NEWS WE GOT OUR MICRO:BIT'S. Finally the wait is over.We were given the micro:bits with batteries and a battery socket and a USB wire.The first thing we were told to do was to read the instructions then we got to compile  codes on it to see how it works. Then we discussed what mobile phones were mostly used for. I learnt that mobile phones were mostly used for social media and grooming. Our homework was to put links to news articals for revenge porn and sexting:

Revenge Porn=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36054273](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36054273)

Sexting=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24539514](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24539514)
