Computer Science lesson 17                     25.09.18

In today's lesson we were working on our bubble code. I made lots of progress and checked my work with my partner’s work, he had lots of extra functions and I checked the work of my other partner and I saw what I needed to improve on. I couldn’t manage to finish the code in the lesson so I managed to finish it for homework. But the only problem is that I can only write the list in the editor not the console and the sorting works perfectly fine and it prints the ordered list.
