Computer science Lesson 15                     18.09.18

In today's lesson we were learning how to sort different data types. There are two methods for this one is bubble sort and the other is merge sort. When bubble sort happens it starts with the first piece of data then it moves to the next one and checks if it is bigger or smaller than the first one, if it is smaller the first one replaces that and takes its place, if it is bigger the first one stays at the front and the second one gets compared to the third one. This process repeats until the largest piece of data is at the top, then it does it again from the beginning till the end. A merge sort is when the pieces of data are put into groups, they are halved over and over again until there are two in one group and one in the other. Then the data gets ordered and the groups get joined and order to smallest at the bottom and largest at the top. This happens until the whole list is put in the right order. Thn at the end of the lesson we made a bubble sort for 2 numbers in a list, we did this by making check and swap functions for the user input.
