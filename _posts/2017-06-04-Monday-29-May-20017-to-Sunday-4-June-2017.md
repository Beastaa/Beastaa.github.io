    <td>I started from where I left off from the last lesson which was the first exercise in functions called, what good are functions?. This was just showing what functions could do. The next exercise was function junction and this was just telling me to make a function called spam that prints Eggs. The next exercise was called call and response all I had to do was to write square(10) on line nine. The  next 2 exercises were easy because they wanted me to fill in the gaps with numeric values or functions. The sixth exercise was wanting me to create two functions and make it cube a number or return false. These exercises were not very challenging because i found them a bit easy to do, but sometimes i wrote in lowercase when it had to be pper case and i made some spelling mistakes.</td>

    <td>I carried on from where i finished of on monday which was on exercise 7 called I know kung fu. This asked me to write print sqrt(25). Then on the next exercise I learned about generic imports I had to write import math print math.sqrt(25) because python doesn't know what sqrt is sand this makes it find it in math. Then in the next two exercises I learned more about function imports and universal imports and how to use them. On the next exercise it hade code which showed me everything in math module. In the next exercise I learned about more functions that are built into python. Then in the next three exercises i learned how to find the largest number in a group of numbers, how to find the smallest number in a group of numbers and how to find the absolute number which is the distance of numbers away from zero of one number. I then learned how to use the type() function. Finally I did a recap lesson about functions. These exercises were fairly easy to do but I kept on making whitespace errors,

    <td>I carried on from where I finished on wednesday which was on exercise 18 called Review: Modules. I had to import sqrt from math to get the square root of 13689 which was 117.0. Then I did a recap of built in functions which made me define a function called distance_from_zero, with one argument that I could chose, then I had to make an if statement other wise it returned to Nope. this was the last exercise in functions so I moved onto taking a vacation. The first three exercises were easy because it was just making functions but when I got to the fourth one I struggled quite a lot but then after looking at the glossary and asking and searching for help I completed it. This was the last exercise I did because it was time consuming and hard.</td>

    <td>I carried on from where I finished on Friday which was on exercise 5 of taking a vacation. This exercise wanted me to make an overall trip cost including plane ride to city, hotel stay and rental car. This was easy because there was an example image and all I had to do was change the functions so that if was relevant to taking a vacation. Then on the next exercise I had to add spending money to the code so I added by putting it in the total cost and the sum of the vacation. Then i had to test the code out by doing an example vacation to los Angeles for five days with 600 dollars spending money. When i finished that I went on to the next course which was python lists and dictionaries. The first exercise was me writing lion after the comma and before the bracket on line one. This was just a list of zoo animals. Then I accessed strings using index numbers. The next exercise wanted me to write code to change tiger into any animal I wanted without deleting tiger but by adding a new piece of code, this was easy to do because above my code there was already code of an animal being replaced so I just looked at tha and used it and changed it. The next one wanted me to add three items to a suit case and like the exercise before it already had sunglasses being added so it was easy to do. The next exercise wanted me to use index again so that it only listed the two middle numbers and the final two numbers. This was the final exercise I had time for but I found these exercises quite easy because it already had examples.</td>
