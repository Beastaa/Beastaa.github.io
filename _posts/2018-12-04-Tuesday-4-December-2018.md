Computer science lesson 33.                                            04.12.18

In today's lesson we were working more on our searching algorithm I managed to make lots of progress a the part of my code that asks questions and works out the upper and lower bound worked. I then realised that there was a easier way to do it so I made my code a comment and I worked on the easier way. I put my code in a loop and made my lists more accurate this helped me write the code that searches for the number.
