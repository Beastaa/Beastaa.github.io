Computer Science lesson 32                                            28.11.18

In today's lesson I was doing more work on my linear and binary search code. I managed to finish my linear search and I made lots of progress in my binary search. Yesterday afternoon I had made some code for my binary search that worked but when I showed it to people in my class they said that I did it wrong so I deleted that and restarted. At the end of the lesson I was told that originally I was doing it right so I copied my current code and got the old version from my history and added my new code on to it so that I could work on it at home.
