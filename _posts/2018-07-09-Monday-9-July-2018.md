Computer Science lesson 9            09.07.18

In today's lesson we were doing coding practice. I managed to make lots of progress through the forest but I got stuck on "Return to Thornbush farm". I tried to use all my resources and various different methods by I couldn't complete it. I asked my partner who was ahead of me and he told me that he had deleted the top of the code and wrote extra under it. I tried to do that but I just couldn't get it to work.
