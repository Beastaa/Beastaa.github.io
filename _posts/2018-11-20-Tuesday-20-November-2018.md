Computer Science lesson 29                                            20.11.18

Today's lesson was a networks test we spent around half the lesson doing the test then at the end we marked someone else's work so that we could learn what type of answers we need to write in future exams. I found out that there doesn't need to be lots of explanations and reasons because all you need is the keep points the question is asking for and then you will get the marks. I also learnt that all the minute details in the questions are useful as if they are used in the answer you will get more marks.
