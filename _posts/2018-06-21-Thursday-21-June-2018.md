Lesson 18                                    21.06.18

In today's lesson we were doing more work on the second version of our quiz. My one did not work at the beginning of the lesson so I had the whole lesson to fix that. I managed to get different versions for my work but then I realised that it was too complicated so I went back to my original one. Then I took little steps to improve it. I just managed to make most of it work by the end of the lesson. I printed all the questions and choices and stored the user input but II wouldn't get the results to print
