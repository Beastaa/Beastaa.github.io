Computer science lesson 22                                            10.10.18

Today's lesson was a cover lesson, I was doing coding practice and I was coding my website on Thimble. I tried to log in and it told me that I didn’t have a password so it sent me an email so that I could make a password. In never received the email so I tried to get it sent multiple times but it still didn’t work. So I made a new account using another email account and another username. I copied my code from my Github style scss into my Thimble css. Then I remembered that I had created a doc that had my previous code in but I also deleted it so I recovered it and used it. At this point I got all my code from my previous lesson and I found out how to change text and add containers. I also found how to do hyperlinks but my code wouldn’t work while my friends did.
