Computer science lesson 34.                                                        05.12.18

In today's lesson I edited and changed my code so that it would work with a user input. I then realised that I had a continuation error but I had no idea what it was so I changed my code and asked different people for help but they did not know what to do as my code looked right, I spent the rest of the lesson trying to fix it but it wouldn't work. At the end of the lesson I asked the teacher for help and he told me that I am asking the print statement to do too many things as I wanted it to make it a string and to check its index.
