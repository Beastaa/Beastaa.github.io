Computer science Lesson 12                                          18.07.18

Today was my last lesson of computer science in year nine and my last lesson before the holidays. But I have an IT lesson tomorrow which I will be doing more coding. In today's lesson I was completing the desert region of code combat, I finished the first path and moved on to the second path which made great progress in. ibrought new armor and a new weapon, I also unlocked a new spells book which gave me access to while loops.
