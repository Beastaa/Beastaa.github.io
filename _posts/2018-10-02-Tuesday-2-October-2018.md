Computer science lesson 19                                             02.10.18

In today's lesson we had a different teacher and she was teaching us networking. I learnt that the world wide web stores web pages and is accessed via the internet. The internet connects us to different things and makes us share things with each other. I learnt how data packets work, when they are sent they are broken down and numbered and it has the sender's address on and the address of the location on, so that if one data packet was missing the receiver can send a message to the address to get the rest of the data packets. We also learned how to identify different URLs and to find where they are created and the different purposes for the URLs.
