Lesson 10                            05.03.18

In today's lesson were were working on our programs on repl.it. Instead of using python (with turtle) like last week, we used python 3. The difference between the two is that in python (with turtle) you can draw shapes and objects while in python 3 you just write code and it will appear on the console. Our main objective was to have a conversation with a person and the program. what we did was make the computer ask questions then a person can reply to it and depending on the reply the next line would be different. In the end of the lesson we found that asking yes or no questions were easier so that if the reply is no then the next line would say "I am sorry to hear that" but if the answer was yes then the next line would say “Oh good for you”.
