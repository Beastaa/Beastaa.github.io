Computer Science lesson 21                                     09.10.18

In Today's lesson we were looking at connectivity. We watched a video about how there are wires under the sea bed which connect different countries to each other. You can send data through the wires. Band with is the amount of data that can be transferred at one time the bigger the bandwidth the more data can be transferred. Wifi is measured with Mbps which is megabytes per second. The difference between lag and latency is that lag is there is too much traffic to get to the destination while latency is when the data has to fo to lots of places to arrive at its destination. We also looked at different cables fibre optic cables are made with glass and they send data as light, this is good because the data can be sent at the speed of light. It is faster to download files from the internet than uploading files to the internet, this is because internet providers prioritise downloading rather than uploading because lots people download rather than upload. Videos buffer because the video is playing faster than the file is being downloaded so the computer slows down the file and stores it in the buffer until it can play the whole file.
