Computer science Lesson 14                           12.09.18

In today's lesson we were talking about cyber security and what is legal to do on technology. We were told that having an eight character password was not safe and it can be hacked easily, this is because many computers check passwords that have eight digits until it is the right one. With the best technology hackers have it takes them 0.2 seconds to hack an eight digit password. We also learnt about computer viruses and that many of them can be downloaded from unsecure websites that you view. Memory stick can have RAT (remote access trojans) and people can control your computers. We learnt that pornography/sex  without consent is illegal, sometimes people cannot give consent, this is when they are being beaten, strangled and ignored if they said no.
