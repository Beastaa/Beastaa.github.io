Lesson 7         5.2.18

In today's lesson we did something different than what we normally do which is our IT business shop. We were making 3 shift ciphers using our prior knowledge. I knew that I needed a vlookup but I didn't know what to put in the vlookup. I struggled a lot at this bit then sir showed us what to do then it all made sense. With the code we were encrypting a message the sir told us to do the exact opposite so we could decrypt an encrypted messageÂ that was sent to us this was basically the same code but the only different thing was we had to add in another alphabet. After that sir showed us how to expand the sheets ad how to resize each cell to only fill one letter. He showed us a new function called contenrate this was to copy all of the cells with letters in a when you pasted ti ther it would come up as one word, this would be used if you were going to send an encrypted message to someone. We also learned how to use keywords in our cypher the word would be written at the top but there could only be one of each letter, then you would write the rest of the alphabet without using the same letter twice.
