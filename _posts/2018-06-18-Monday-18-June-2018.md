Computer science lesson 3               18.06.18

In today's lesson we were doing more on binary addition. I found this really fun because it was really easy because I learnt how to do it last lesson and this was just recap for me which I completed really fast. This meant I had more questions to do once I finished and we had a race with our teacher who gave us a head start and I managed to finish before him but with all of his experience he managed to beat some other people. I also managed to make lots of notes in my notes document because our teacher gave us a lot of info to write down like when you times a binary number by 2 you just do a binary shift to the left and if you divide by two you do a binary shift to the left.
