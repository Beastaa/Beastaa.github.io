Lesson 16             14.05.18

In today's lesson we were looking at a different way of making a multiple choice quiz. This way was much more quicker and it had less code so it was more useful and effective. In this we made variables and functions such as answers_of_questions, we ended up with a total of 8 variables. I managed to write all the questions and most of the answers but I cannot run the code because there is a problem with it that I can't solve. I worked on a new repl in python 3.
