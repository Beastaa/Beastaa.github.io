Computer Science lesson 28                                       14.11.18

Today's lesson was a revision lesson, this is because next Tuesday we will have a networks test on all that we have covered in class. During the lesson I read chapter 5 on the online textbook and answered the questions and I also went through everything that was posted on classroom about networks which included the presentations and the homeworks. Once I did that I started to go through chapter 5 on the PG textbook which explained each point clearly. I focused on the topologies and authentication part as I felt like that was important and I needed to know more about it. I learnt the network layers by using **a**ll **t**he **n**etwork **l**ayers which means application layer, transport layer, network layer and link layer. When someone uses the layers it goes along the order so the data from the application layer will get packaged at the transport layer, it will also be error checked, corrected, numbered and the address will be in it. Then it get packaged at the network layer, it then goes to the link layer where it gets sent to the recipient then it gets unpackaged in the reverse order.
