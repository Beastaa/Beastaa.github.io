Computer science Lesson 5                    25.06.18

In today's less on we were focusing on the hardware and processor of the computer. We went on little man computer which was a program where you can input numbers and code to add, subtract, multiply and other ones here is the link [https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/). This showed us the processes of where the numbers go for their functions. We also looked at CPU Fetch-Decode-Execute Animation by heartismere this showed us how the processor followed a set of insteuctions here is the link [www.hartismere.com/CPU-Fetch-Decode-Execute-Animation-20398](www.hartismere.com/CPU-Fetch-Decode-Execute-Animation-20398). It showed where the busses would travel to and what will change.
