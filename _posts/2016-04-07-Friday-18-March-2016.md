In this week's lesson we looked at a presentation site called Prezi. We talked about how to present things properly e.g. looking at your audience as you speak, vary your tone, if your presentation is on a board do not read everything on the board. Then we looked at a few Prezi presentations our teacher made and he told us how to properly use Prezi.
