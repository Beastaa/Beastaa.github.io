Lesson 21                   12.07.18

In today's lesson we were doing more coding practice. I started on the return to "Thornbush" farm level which I still struggled a lot on. Half way through the lesson I decided to go on to codecademy and practice some of my code because I was struggling on that level. After I while i realised that I should try out various other levels of Codecombat. I found a really fun and challenging one so I decided to spend the rest of the lesson on that. By the end of the lesson I managed to make lots of progress through that level but I could not complete it.
