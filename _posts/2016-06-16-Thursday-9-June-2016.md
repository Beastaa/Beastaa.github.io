As you may have realised today isn't a friday and I usually blog on Friday this is because my IT lesson is moved to a Thursday and it will stay like that until the end of the summer term. Today we were carrying on doing micro:bit tutorials. At the end of the lesson the teacher told us our homework was to make a planning doc about making our own micro:bit game. These were the categories;

 

1) Name of Game

2) Purpose of game

3) Number of players

4) What inputs will the game have?

5) What processes will the program calculate?

6) What outputs will the game have? 

Your game should have selection(if) and iteration (while or For)
