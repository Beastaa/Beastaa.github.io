In class we were talking about the advantages and disadvantages of social media.On the board we made a column and one half we wrote advantages on the other half was disadvantages. We said posting to your friends could put you in danger because they might not like what you posted and get angry with you. We played this activity when you got paper with writing on it and put them in order starting with the least danger and ending with the most danger.
