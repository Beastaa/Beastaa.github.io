This week in class we were looking at our Identity Maps which we did in the half term holiday. 

When I started I struggled a lot but I knew that it will look good in the end. I didn't know what the class would think and my main worries were the drawings and the writing. Before friday I didn't know there were going to be comments. When I looked at my comments I liked the fact that they were nice comments. I enjoyed the process but  I would have understood more if the person was commenting face to face because they could explain what they mean. I felt happy that there were comments because it told me what i did good at and what I should improve. I was surprised that most people liked what i did. This is different because if someone you didn't know commented you don't know how they look like and their personalities so they could post rude comments. I would post more about what I like and less personal stuff. There aren't any changes I want to make in the social media I use. The six lessons we had made me more aware of the dangers of social media. The lessons have made me change how I use social media in the future because now I know I should make sure I wonâ€™t regret any comments I post.
